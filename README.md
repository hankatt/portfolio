An experiement heavily using CSS's [clamp](chttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) functionality to create more fluid responsive designs. It's a manifestation of a past conviction of mine, that doing responsive design based on a "mobile", "tablet" and "desktop" viewport is an antiquated perspective and that we're converging towards an environment where we can't really make any assumptions around what device someone is using. I've called this "device agnostic responsive design".
