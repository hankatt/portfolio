            Making our own workaround for the missing gap in Flexbox

            We tried implementing our grid in different ways before I settled on Flex, but it came with a gap. It had no logic for managing column gaps. I implemented a workaround that allowed us to make a simple responsive layout framework. About a year later gap came to the Flex layout model in CSS, and we could replace my workaround. I’m proud of this because it confirms that the workarounds I pushed for did fill a legit gap in the industry tooling out there, while we at the same time could provide simple tooling for a year longer than we would’ve otherwise.

            Responsive design not based on device but based on @container
          </h1>
          <p className="text-medium faded">
            Historically responsive design has been rooted in this notion of a mobile device, a tablet device, and a desktop device. I’m arguing that the line between these devices are blurring and it is not meaningful make component design decisions this way, and I’m calling it device-agnostic design™. This is why we implemented a system for our components to just look at the size given to them, regardless of device, and render a layout accordingly. This existed then and exists today in CSS, but browser support was not reliable at the time.

          Some components I designed
        </h1>
        <p className="section-introduction body-text faded">
          To mitigate design inconsistencies and increase quality, I designed and helped implement components that systematized shared needs. This helped product teams achieve a reliable UI faster and functioned as a tool for managing and maintaining interfaces as well as product and brand alignment.

          <h1 className="text-large">Filters wrapper</h1>
          <h1 className="faded text-large">A responsive layout system for the unpredictable future.</h1>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            This component is different in the sense that it is more of a layout manager than a typical UI component that handles user interaction. The Filters wrapper provides behaviour and customization so that developers easily can achieve the designs designers have in their disposal toolbox.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            The wrapper enables an array of modes to manage all kinds of responsive behaviour, but defaults to the horizontal filters row and collapses to a single button when the filters no longer fit.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            The vertical mode used in for example the pop-out to the right on the tablet also enables side-by-side layouts on desktop.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            The collapsing of all filter options into a Filters button is customizable to be triggered at any given width or breakpoint.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded"> 
            The mobile layout reuses the pop-out from the tablet but snaps it to the bottom of the screen and limits its height to a default value with the option to override. It’s capped to maintain the visibility of tapped elements.

          <h1 className="faded text-large">Multiselection and cross-platform support.</h1>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            For a long time we relied on native dropdowns to avoid the risk of issues that comes with replacing something native. For example, it was important to maintain the keyboard-navigation support we’ve had since the start.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            But user needs such as multi-selection, searching amongst existing filters and select all outgrow the capabilities of the default selector. The new options panel is flexible in the presentation of options while maintaining functionality for on all devices.
          </p>

          <h1 className="faded text-large">A dynamic foundation for the unpredictable.</h1>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            When creating the drop-down panel (options panel) we defaulted to rendering our drop-down inputs with it. These input fields triggered the panel and then updated based on selections.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            It fell short as I realized that some use-cases required a more refined visual hierarchy, and these inputs have a fairly large footprint.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            We still kept them as the default but we wanted it to be easy for developers to trigger the options panel from a different UI element than the drop-down, say a button for example.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            We experimented with passing in a preferred type as a prop and then render the preferred component in its place. This did not fly. We’d need to manage the interaction, data passage and state between the triggering element (trigger) and the options panel ourselves for each new trigger someone comes up with.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            This led me to propose an implementation that would let developers pick any UI element and trigger the options panel from their element of choosing, and the options panel would return its state so that the developer could update the state of the trigger as seen fit.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            This concept was how we finally implemented the component in our component library. It was exciting to have UI design needs inspire a software design pattern that ended up improving our final solution.

          <p className="body-text faded">
            Many teams need to provide a lot of data but lack resources both in design and in front-end, but they still had to find a way of doing it. This led to an inconsistent Merchant Portal, both in design and implementation.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            This need was mainly met through tables. These tables make up a significant part of the user experience and as such, was a great candidate for our Design System team to refine and componetize. This component significantly raised the visual and user experience in the product, and most of all saved teams loads of time.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            This component was also one of the biggest challenges in making the Merchant Portal responsive. If we solved this, it was all downhill from here.

            Some teams need to trigger the Search manually. I added the button inside of the search field. This allows teams to simply “turn it on” without any layout implications, since the field maintains its footprint.
          </p>
          <p className="body-text faded">
            Input chips were designed to batch manage users. End-users often had lists of e-mails that they wanted to manage. The Chip input field parses, inline validates and chips the pasted content.
